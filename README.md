# Alpyca
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arturmiller/alpyca.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arturmiller/alpyca)

Developing robots is a hard task. ROS makes it simpler, but it is still not as easy as it could be. The main idea is to make robot development with ROS as easy as possible. It is a library with an interface completely in Python.

## Python instead of C++
Robotic development is still very C++ centric. This can be also seen in ROS. Many libraries just exist for C++ and those which support Python, just have the same interface as C++. They arn't really "pythonic". Since Python is much simpler, especially for beginners the interface of Alpyca is written completely in Python and the strengths of Python are utilised as good as possible.

## Documentation
The documentation of many ROS libraries could be improved, even for standard libraries. The goal of Alpyca is to have good complete documentation to make the barriers of entry as low as possible.

## Installation
TODO

## License
